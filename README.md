# freeze-browser

**Freeze browser** is a Rust-based browser that is safer than Chrome and open-source, but not Chromium. ðŸ¦€

We chose Rust for its strong memory safety guarantees, which help prevent common bugs like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows. The language's performance and concurrency features also make it a great choice for building a high-performance browser. ðŸš€
