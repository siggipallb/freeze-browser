# freeze-browser

**Freeze browser** is a Rust-based browser that is safer than Chrome and open-source, but not Chromium. 🦀

We chose Rust for its strong memory safety guarantees, which help prevent common bugs like null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows. The language's performance and concurrency features also make it a great choice for building a high-performance browser. 🚀

Why we are not using Chromium? Because it's a huge codebase and it's hard to maintain. We want to keep the codebase small and simple. 🧰

Are we trying to compete with Chromium and GeckoEngine? Yes and no. We are trying to build a browser that is built with safety from the ground up. 🏗️

The reason we are building a whole goddamn browser is that we want a browser engine that is not controlled by an organization or a company. ✨
